# Watch on Nebula [not working yet]

This Web Extension for Safari could one day check if a Youtube video is available to watch on Nebula and alert the user.

So far, the extension extracts the video title and creator name and checks the latter against a local list that was manually compiled.

To do:
* either implement a working check if a creator exists on Nebula, or implement an updating strategy so that the creator list stays up to date
* implement a notification to the user whenever a video is indeed available on Nebula, and offer to redirect to it via a simple click.

Current status: Due to an unknown error that I cannot identify anywhere in the code or my machine's console, the extension is no longer loaded. The project is on hold for now.
